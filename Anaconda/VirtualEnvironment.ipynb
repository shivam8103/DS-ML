    "## Why use virtual environments:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. **Keep projects separate:** Each notebook can use its own Python and package versions, so one project won’t break another.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:** Project A needs pandas 1.5 and Project B needs pandas 2.0. Virtual environments let both coexist.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. **Prevent code from breaking:** Even if you update Python or packages on your computer, your notebook will keep running smoothly.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. **Easier sharing and deployment:** When you send your notebook to someone or deploy it, only the required packages are included, not all packages from your computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. **Good practice for multiple projects:** Every new project should have its own environment to avoid confusion and messy dependencies."
