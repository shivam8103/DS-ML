    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Uses of database\n",
    "1. **Data Storage:** Used to store a large amounts of structured data, making it easily accessibl, searchable and retrievable,\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Data Analaysis:** A database can be used to perform complext data analysis, generate reports and provide insights into the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Record Keeping:** A database is often used to keep track of important records, such as financial transactions, customer information, and inventory levels. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Web Applications:** Databases are an essential component of many web applications, providing dynamic content and user management. \n",

    "## Properties of Ideal Database\n",
    "1. **Integrity** = Accuracy + Consistency. Data should remain correct and unchanged unless intentionally updated through valid processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Availablity:** Should have zero downtime; data must be accessible 24Ã—7.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Security**: Protects data from unauthorized access, breaches, or corruption.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Application Independence**: A single database should be usable by multiple applications (e.g., web, Android, macOS) without dependency on any one of them.\n",
