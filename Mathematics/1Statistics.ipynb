    "**Inferential statistics** is a branch of statistics that deals with making inferences or predictions\n",

    "inferential statistics are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Hypothesis testing:** This involves testing a hypothesis about a population parameter based\n",
    "on a sample of data. For example, testing whether the mean height of a population is\n",
    "different from a given value.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Confidence intervals:** This involves estimating the range of values that a population\n",
    "parameter could take based on a sample of data. For example, estimating the population\n",
    "mean height within a given confidence level.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Analysis of variance (ANOVA):** This involves comparing means across multiple groups to\n",
    "determine if there are any significant differences. For example, comparing the mean\n",
    "height of individuals from different regions.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Regression analysis:** This involves modelling the relationship between a dependent\n",
    "variable and one or more independent variables. For example, predicting the sales of a\n",
    "product based on advertising expenditure.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Chi-square tests:** This involves testing the independence or association between two\n",
    "categorical variables. For example, testing whether gender and occupation are\n",
    "independent variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Sampling techniques:** This involves ensuring that the sample of data is representative of\n",
    "the population. For example, using random sampling to select individuals from a\n",
    "population.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Bayesian statistics:** This is an alternative approach to statistical inference that involves\n",

    "updating the probability of a disease given a positive test result.\n",
